# Change log

## Version [4.0.0](https://github.com/auth0/jwt-decode/releases/tag/v4.0.0)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/auth0/jwt-decode/compare/v3.1.2..v4.0.0)

A new version of the library, including a couple of improvements:

- No longer include a polyfill for [atob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/atob), as this is [supported in all major browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=atob) (and [node environments > 14](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/atob#browser_compatibility)).
- Compile to ES2017, dropping support for anything that does not support ES2017 (which should be very limited [according to caniuse](https://caniuse.com/?search=es2017))
- Use Node's atob when running on node.
- Drop support for Node 14 and 16, add support for Node 20.
- Add support for package.json's `exports` field, for better CJS/ESM support
- Reorganize build artifacts for better CJS/ESM support (cjs and esm needs to be their own directory with a cjs specific package.json file)
- Drop manual UMD bundle creation in `index.standalone.ts`, but rely on rollup instead.
- Infer JwtPayload and JwtHeader default types from the `header` argument by using overloads.

Even though some users might experience breaking changes, mostly because of the `exports` field, the majority should be able to update without making any changes, assuming the SDK is used in environments with support for `atob`.

### Migration to v4.0.0

The `jwtDecode` function is now no longer the default export, and is instead provided as a named export. Make sure to update your code in places where you are importing this function:

```diff
-import jwtDecode from "jwt-decode";
+import { jwtDecode } from "jwt-decode";
```
